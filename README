Base Tornado App for dead simple projects.
==========================================

Tornado base app is (as its name suggests) a tornado app which do all the boring stuff for you.

Usage (default settings):

    ./app.py

If you use stuff like Twitter's OAuth, you may have different settings in production and in development.

    ./app.py --version=version

Will override default settings with extra settings.
